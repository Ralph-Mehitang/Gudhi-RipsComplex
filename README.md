"# Gudhi-RipsComplex" 
1. The data set is a research on the minimum, average and maximum upload speeds 
among every county in the state of maryland.
2.  From the scatter plot we are able to conclude that Baltimore county has the fastest upload speed, with speeds of 20000 mbps, while talbot county has the slowest at under 3000 mbps.
3. In orfer to get these results the state of MD researchers tested the speeds of homes, business and other buildings in each counties and used those scores to represent their data.
